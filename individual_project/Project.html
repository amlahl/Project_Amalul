        <h1>Hi, nice to meet you ! ^_^ <br> My name is B.J. Amalul Ahli. You can call me Amalul or just BJ !</h1>
        <p><span>Lately,</span> I want to have some skills related to web design and development. 
          Now I begin my new journey and take steps to gather any knowledge related to JavaScript, HTML & CSS. 
          It's all thanks to Glints Academy Team, Progate and Delarta Tok Adin as my mentor. 
          I will never forget your support ! *thumbsup
        </p>
        <p>My background experiences and education are not related to web design and development. 
          But I found myself that I am full of curiosty about how the websites and programs (software pc, smartphone app, etc) works. 
          When I saw an announcement from @glintsid on Instagram about Glints Academy Intensive Bootcamp Program, 
          I think this is my chance to begin with. 
          Sad to know that I am in Batch 14. 
          I wonder if I apply since the 1st class. 
          I think I should be more updated to the informations out there. 
          But again it's never too late to take the steps ! *thumbsup 
          The future is up ahead ! 
          So let's manage to make the better future to reach ! ^_^
        </p>
        <p><span>Long</span> time ago before I graduated from high school, 
          I want to continue my study in the Information Technology major. 
          Then I  tried to reach any reputable state universities. 
          But I didn't make it because of my passing grade couldn't reach the minimum score standard.
          Then, there was a private university promoting their education services which have Information Technology major.
          I took the chance to apply.
          I got accepted by a private university. 
          So, the private university invited me and my parents to join their event to socialize the further steps to take. 
          After my parents saw the tuition fee and how much my parents should afford for me to take the study, 
          My parents gave me a statement which is they couldn't proceed the payment because they also think about my brothers future education, 
          Then, my parents suggested me to choose another major which is affordable to take. 
          Well it was so sad for me.
        </p>
